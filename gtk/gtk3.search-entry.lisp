  @begin{short}
    The @class{gtk:search-entry} class is a subclass of the @class{gtk:entry}
    class that has been tailored for use as a search entry.
  @end{short}

  @image[search-entry]{Figure: GtkSearchEntry}

  It will show an inactive symbolic \"find\" icon when the search entry is
  empty, and a symbolic \"clear\" icon when there is text. Clicking on the
  \"clear\" icon will empty the search entry.

  Note that the search/clear icon is shown using a secondary icon, and thus
  does not work if you are using the secondary icon position for some other
  purpose.

  To make filtering appear more reactive, it is a good idea to not react to
  every change in the entry text immediately, but only after a short delay.
  To support this, the @class{gtk:search-entry} widget emits the
  @sig[gtk:search-entry]{search-changed} signal which can be used instead of
  the @sig[gtk:editable]{changed} signal.
  @begin[Signal Details]{dictionary}
    @begin[search-entry::next-match]{signal}

        @entry[entry]{The @class{gtk:search-entry} widget on which the signal
          was emitted.}
      @end{simple-table}
      The signal is a keybinding signal which gets emitted when the user
      initiates a move to the next match for the current search string.
      Applications should connect to it, to implement moving between matches.
      The default bindings for this signal is the @kbd{Ctrl-g} key.
    @end{signal}
    @begin[search-entry::previous-match]{signal}

      The signal is a keybinding signal which gets emitted when the user
      initiates a move to the previous match for the current search string.
      Applications should connect to it, to implement moving between matches.
      The default bindings for this signal is the @kbd{Ctrl-Shift-g} key.

        @entry[entry]{The @class{gtk:search-entry} widget on which the signal
          was emitted.}
      @end{simple-table}
      The signal is emitted with a short delay of 150 milliseconds after the
      last change to the entry text.
    @end{signal}
    @begin[search-entry::stop-search]{signal}
      @begin{pre}

        @entry[entry]{The @class{gtk:search-entry} widget on which the signal
          was emitted.}
      @end{simple-table}
      The signal is a keybinding signal which gets emitted when the user stops
      a search via keyboard input. Applications should connect to it, to
      implement hiding the search entry in this case. The default bindings for
      this signal is the @kbd{Escape} key.

  @begin{short}
    This function should be called when the toplevel window which contains the
    search entry received a key event.
  @end{short}
  If the entry is part of a search bar, it is preferable to call the
  @fun{gtk:search-bar-handle-event} function instead, which will reveal the
  entry in addition to passing the event to this function.

  If the key event is handled by the search entry and starts or continues a
  search, the @var{gdk:+event-stop+} value will be returned. The caller
  should ensure that the entry is shown in this case, and not propagate the
  event further.
