 "@version{2025-06-29}
  @begin{short}
    In addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user interface input, GDK
    contains support for a variety of input devices, including graphics tablets,
    touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards interacting simultaneously
    with the user interface. Such input devices often have additional features,
    such as sub-pixel positioning information and additional device-dependent
    information.
  @end{short}

  In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the device
  hierarchy, such as virtual devices being created or removed, or physical
  devices being plugged or unplugged, GDK provides the
  @class{gdk:device-manager} object.

  By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
  keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be changed
  by calling the @fun{gdk:disable-multidevice} function before the
  @fun{gdk:display-open} function. There should rarely be a need to do that
  though, since GDK defaults to a compatibility mode in which it will emit just
  one enter/leave event pair for all devices on a window. To enable per-device
  enter/leave events and other multi-pointer interaction features, the
  @fun{gdk:window-support-multidevice} function must be called on
  @class{gdk:window} objects, or the @fun{gtk:widget-support-multidevice}
  function on widgets. See the @fun{gdk:window-support-multidevice}
  documentation for more information.

  On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2. Unless the
  @fun{gdk:disable-multidevice} function is called, the XInput 2
  @class{gdk:device-manager} implementation will be used as the input source.
  Otherwise either the core or XInput 1 implementations will be used.

  For simple applications that do not have any special interest in input
  devices, the so-called client pointer provides a reasonable approximation to
  a simple setup with a single pointer and keyboard. The device that has been
  set as the client pointer can be accessed via the
  @fun{gdk:device-manager-client-pointer} function.

  Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual devices,
  or master devices. are represented by the pointer cursors and keyboard foci
  that are seen on the screen. Physical devices, or slave devices, represent
  the hardware that is controlling the virtual devices, and thus have no
  visible cursor on the screen.

  Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
  pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through the
  @fun{gdk:device-associated-device} function.

  There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could be
  controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also be
  \"floating\", which means they are not attached to any virtual device.

  @b{Example:} Master and slave devices
  @begin{pre}
 carlossacarino:~$ xinput list
 ⎡ Virtual core pointer               id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
 ⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer     id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]
 ⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E6 Pen stylus      id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]
 ⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch    id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]
 ⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad     id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]
 ⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint          id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]
 ⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E6 Pen eraser      id=16   [slave  pointer  (2)]
 ⎣ Virtual core keyboard              id=3    [master keyboard (2)]
     ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard    id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]
     ↳ Power Button                   id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]
     ↳ Video Bus                      id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]
     ↳ Sleep Button                   id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]
     ↳ Integrated Camera              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]
     ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard   id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]
     ↳ ThinkPad Extra Buttons         id=15   [slave  keyboard (3)]
  @end{pre}
  By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all master
  devices, setting the @class{gdk:device} object for all events coming from
  input devices. Events containing device information are @code{:motion-notify},
  @code{:button-press}, @code{:2button-press}, @code{:3button-press},
  @code{:button-release}, @code{:scroll}, @code{:key-press},
  @code{:key-release}, @code{:enter-notify}, @code{:leave-notify},
  @code{:focus-change}, @code{:proximity-in}, @code{:proximity-out},
  @code{:drag-enter}, @code{:drag-leave}, @code{:drag-motion},
  @code{:drag-status}, @code{:drop-start}, @code{:drop-finished} and
  @code{:grab-broken}. When dealing with an event on a master device, it is
  possible to get the source (slave) device that the event originated from via
  the @fun{gdk:event-source-device} function.

  In order to listen for events coming from devices other than a virtual device,
  the @fun{gdk:window-device-events} function must be called. Generally, this
  function can be used to modify the event mask for any given device.

  Input devices may also provide additional information besides x/y. For
  example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and x/y tilt
  information. This information is device-dependent, and may be queried
  through the @fun{gdk:device-axis} function. In multidevice mode, virtual
  devices will change axes in order to always represent the physical device
  that is routing events through it. Whenever the physical device changes, the
  \"n-axes\" property will be notified, and the @fun{gdk:device-list-axes}
  function will return the new device axes.

  Devices may also have associated keys or macro buttons. Such keys can be
  globally set to map into normal X keyboard events. The mapping is set using
  the @fun{gdk:device-key} function.

  In GTK 3.20, a new @class{gdk:seat} object has been introduced that
  supersedes the @class{gdk:device-manager} object and should be preferred in
  newly written code.

          signal is emitted.}
        @entry[device]{The newly added @class{gdk:device} object.}
      @end{simple-table}
      The signal is emitted either when a new master pointer is created, or
      when a slave (hardware) input device is plugged in.
    @end{signal}
    @begin[device-manager::device-changed]{signal}
      @begin{pre}

          signal is emitted.}
        @entry[device]{The @class{gdk:device} object that changed.}
      @end{simple-table}
      The signal is emitted whenever a device has changed in the hierarchy,
      either slave devices being disconnected from their master device or
      connected to another one, or master devices being added or removed a
      slave device. If a slave device is detached from all master devices its
      @sym{gdk:device-type} value will change to the
      @val[gdk:device-type]{:floating} value, if it is attached, it will change
      to the @val[gdk:device-type]{:slave} value.
    @end{signal}
    @begin[device-manager::device-removed]{signal}
      @begin{pre}

          signal is emitted.}
        @entry[device]{The just removed @class{gdk:device} object.}
      @end{simple-table}
      The signal is emitted either when a master pointer is removed, or when a
      slave (hardware) input device is unplugged.

  This call must happen prior to the @fun{gdk:display-open}, @code{gtk_init()},

  Most common GTK applications will not ever need to call this. Only

  support if such Xlib code deals with input devices in any way and does not
  observe the presence of XInput 2.
